# Background
The transfer and re-use of existing risk assessment knowledge, ranging from various types of data, predictive models up to risk assessment model code, is still a major bottleneck in the area of risk assessment. The Risk Assessment Knowledge Integration Platform (RAKIP) Initiative is a network of governmental agencies and universities that jointly develop resources to facilitate an efficient exchange of risk assessment models and data. A harmonised information exchange format for models and data, the so-called Food Safety Knowledge Exchange (FSKX) format, stands therefore at the centre of the RAKIP strategy. To promote the widespread adoption of FSKX in various scientific disciplines relevant for risk assessment, the RAKIP Initiative developed a number of software tools that support the generation, execution and even joining of FSKX files. Additionally, a web-based repository for FSKX models and data has been developed, the so-called “RAKIP-Web Repository”.
The cooperation agreement between EFSA, BfR, ANSES and DTU-Food is called "RAKIP Initiative agreement". In contrast to the submitted proposal this agreement does not contain any financial implications or binds any initiative members to perform specific tasks. The main purpose of the RAKIP Initiative is to promote the RAKIP idea and to mutually support activities that allow for efficient exchange of data and models in the risk assessment domain. One specific outcome of the RAKIP Initiative was therefore, that RAKIP Initiative members agreed to collaborate in the following tailor-made task proposal, which would allow to achieve specific milestones and perform dissemination activities as described in the proposal.

# Objectives
To enhance collaboration, promote the broader adoption of FSKX and increase the value of the RAKIP-Web Repository it is planned to implement the following actions in this tailor-made task project:

- Establish a network of FSKX stewards that support modellers and researchers in their efforts to provide knowledge to RAKIP-Web, i.e. in an FSX-compliant way. FSKX stewards will also support the curation of models and data submitted to RAKIP-Web, so that the content in RAKIP-Web complies to the highest possible quality standards. FSKX stewards will provide support to modellers and researchers in using software tools like FSK-Lab and the model execution infrastructure linked to RAKIP-Web and the FESMJ journal.

- Broaden the support for the FSKX exchange format in various software tools used by risk assessors and risk modellers to make the adoption of FSKX as a harmonised knowledge exchange format as convenient as possible.

- Extend the content of the RAKIP-Web Repository with new models and data from various risk assessment domains to promote the use of RAKIP-Web as a One Health knowledge resource.
