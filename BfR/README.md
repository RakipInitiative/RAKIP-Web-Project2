# Project overview

## Project name
Legacy Models Conversion to FSKX Format

## Project description
The Legacy Models Conversion project was established to provide a comprehensive guide on converting legacy models into the FSKX format using the FSK-Lab extension in KNIME, as well as through the FSKX online service. The guide, documented in the project's GitLab [Wiki](https://gitlab.bfr.berlin/Omari/legacy-models-conversion/-/wikis/home), offers detailed explanations and step-by-step instructions for model conversion, facilitating the transition to the FSKX format, which is essential for ensuring model standardization and interoperability. Additionally, the project documents any issues or challenges encountered during the model conversion process in [the issues](https://gitlab.bfr.berlin/fskx-exchange-hub/legacy-models-conversion-to-fskx-format/-/issues/?sort=created_date&state=opened&first_page_size=100) section of GitLab, ensuring that potential problems are addressed and tracked to support a smooth workflow for users.

## Definition of done
- [The Metabolic-Reproductive model](https://biologydirect.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13062-019-0256-7) was successfully converted from MATLAB to Octave.
- Octave is now supported by our FSK model conversion tools.

- The Metabolic-Reproductive model has been converted to FSKX format, curated and uploaded to the RAKIP web repository.


- The FSK-Lab nodes were tested for converting models to FSKX formats. Issues encountered during the conversion process have been documented in [the issues](https://gitlab.bfr.berlin/fskx-exchange-hub/legacy-models-conversion-to-fskx-format/-/issues/?sort=created_date&state=opened&first_page_size=100) section.
- A new FSK-Lab node called The Conda environment KNIME node has been developed and is available for supporting model conversion.
    - Tutorials (written and video) are provided for the Conda environment node.

- The FSKX online model creation service is established.
    - Tutorials (written and video) are provided for the FSKX online model creation service.

- The Self-Organized model developed in FG43, alongside the Metabolic-Reproductive model and other models, has been used to test the newly developed FSKX online model creation service. Observations and recommendations for improving the service have been documented and submitted in [the issues](https://gitlab.bfr.berlin/fskx-exchange-hub/fskx-microservice-platform/-/issues/?sort=created_date&state=opened&first_page_size=100) section.

- A streamlined version of FSKX, called eFSKX, has been developed with a corresponding reduced metadata schema (see also [here](https://gitlab.bfr.berlin/fskx-exchange-hub/efskx-guidance-document)).
- Knowledge of these tools and services has been disseminated within the scientific community.
